Florida wins first FDA approval to import cheaper drugs from Canada,"Pharmacist Thomas Jensen looks over a prescription drug at the Rock Canyon Pharmacy in Provo, Utah, on May 9, 2019.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved Florida's plan to import cheaper prescription drugs from Canada, a first-in-the-nation move that could reduce costs for Americans but faces fierce opposition from the pharmaceutical industry.

The regulator also said it was committed to working with other states seeking to import drugs from Canada.

The FDA's approval of Florida's plan is a significant stride forward in a broader, yearslong effort to rein in drug costs in the U.S. Patients shell out significantly more for medicines than they do in Canada and some other countries.

Drug importation could open up a new and cheaper source of drugs beyond the retail and mail-order pharmacies that Americans typically rely on to fill prescriptions.

Along with Florida, other states such as Colorado, North Dakota and Vermont have their own drug importation plans in place, which will require FDA approvals. More than five states have asked the agency to greenlight their programs, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

But Florida's newly approved plan will likely face hurdles before it takes effect, including potential lawsuits from the pharmaceutical industry.

Drugmakers have long argued that importation may introduce counterfeit medicines into the U.S. supply chain and harm patients — a concern the FDA previously raised because the agency can't guarantee the safety of those drugs.

However, the FDA's Friday approval appears to have guardrails that aim to mitigate potential safety issues.

Before Florida can distribute Canadian drugs, the state must send the FDA details on the medications it plans to import, ensure that those treatments are not counterfeit or ineffective and relabel those drugs to be consistent with FDA-approved labeling.

Florida must also submit quarterly reports to the agency about cost savings and potential safety issues, among other obligations. The FDA's approval allows Florida to import drugs for two years from the date of the first drug shipment.

""These proposals must demonstrate the programs would result in significant cost savings to consumers without adding risk of exposure to unsafe or ineffective drugs,"" FDA Commissioner Robert Califf said in a statement.

The pharmaceutical industry pushed back on the FDA's move on Friday.

Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the industry's biggest lobbying group, called the FDA's approval of Florida's plan ""reckless"" and said it is considering ""all options for preventing this policy from harming patients.""

""Ensuring patients have access to needed medicines is critical, but the importation of unapproved medicines, whether from Canada or elsewhere in the world, poses a serious danger to public health,"" Stephen Ubl, CEO of PhRMA, said. ""Politicians need to stop getting between Americans and their health care.""

The group sued the FDA in 2020 over a Trump administration plan to import Canadian drugs, but that lawsuit was later dismissed.

President Joe Biden issued an executive order in July 2021 that included a call for the FDA to work with states on plans for importing drugs from Canada.

"NCAA and ESPN ink 8-year, $920 million media rights deal","An ESPN GameDay logo is displayed at the Capital One Orange Bowl game between the Georgia Bulldogs and the Florida State Seminoles at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, on Dec. 30, 2023.

The NCAA and ESPN have reached a new eight-year media rights deal worth more than $115 million annually, as the value of sports media rights reaches new heights.

The new agreement carries an annual value of roughly three times the current 14-year deal, which pays about $40 million annually.

An NCAA spokesperson confirmed an additional 25%, or $28.75 million annually, will help with production and marketing costs.

""ESPN and the NCAA have enjoyed a strong and collaborative relationship for more than four decades, and we are thrilled that it will continue as part of this new, long-term agreement,"" said ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro.

The new deal is effective Sept. 1 and runs through 2032. It will include the rights to 40 NCAA championships — 21 women's and 19 men's events — as well as exclusive championship coverage of all rounds for women's basketball, women's volleyball, women's gymnastics, softball, baseball and FCS football. It also provides international rights to the 40 championships and the Division I men's basketball championship.

""Having one, multi-platform home to showcase our championships provides additional growth potential along with a greater experience for the viewer and our student-athletes,"" NCAA President Charlie Baker said in a statement.

As the sports media landscape changes, women's sports have been a bright spot, as they notch record ratings in recent years. ESPN has benefited through its airing of the NCAA women's basketball tournament and the WNBA playoffs, among other sports.

Endeavor's IMG and WME Sports, who consulted for the NCAA on the deal, say about 57% of the value of the deal is tied to women's college basketball specifically, Baker told the Associated Press.

The NCAA said the dramatic increase in the value of the NCAA's media rights will allow it to explore revenue distribution units for the women's basketball tournament, a topic the organization began discussing last year.

Last year, complaints of inequality overshadowed the women's tournament as several players posted on social media that their facilities were significantly worse than the men's facilities.

""Concurrent with the terms of the new media rights, several enhancements to student-athlete benefits across all three NCAA divisions will take effect, and this deal will help fund those important programs. And the national, integrated platform the family of ESPN networks provides will help grow the visibility of many NCAA sports, particularly for our women student-athletes,"" said Linda Livingstone, chair of the NCAA Board of Governors and Baylor University president.

ESPN and the NCAA's relationship has lasted more than 45 years, since ESPN launched in 1979.

The NBA has the next major professional sports rights up for grabs. The league is in negotiations with a plethora of interested parties as it looks to make its decision before the current deal expires following the 2024-25 season.

Coinbase is planning a pivotal acquisition that will allow it to launch crypto derivatives in the EU,"LONDON, ENGLAND - NOVEMBER 09: In this photo illustration, a flipped version of the Coinbase logo is reflected in a mobile phone screen on November 09, 2021 in London, England. The cryptocurrency exchange platform is to release its quarterly earnings today. (Photo illustration by Leon Neal/Getty Images)



Coinbase plans to offer crypto-linked derivatives in the European Union, and it's planning to acquire a company with a license to do so.

The U.S. cryptocurrency exchange told CNBC exclusively that it entered into an agreement to buy an unnamed holding company which owns a MiFID II license.

MiFID II refers to the EU's updated rules governing financial instruments. The EU updated the legislation in 2017 to address criticism that it was too focused on stocks and didn't consider other asset classes, like fixed income, derivatives and currencies.

It's part of a long-standing ambition by Coinbase to serve professional and institutional customers.

The company, which began 12 years ago, has been seeking to expand its offering to institutions such as hedge funds and high-frequency trading firms over the last several years, looking to benefit from the much higher sizes of transactions done by these kinds of traders.

If and when Coinbase completes the deal, the move would mark the first launch of derivatives trading by the company in the EU.

With a MiFID II license, Coinbase will be able to begin offering regulated derivatives, like futures and options, in the EU. The company already offers spot trading in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

The deal is subject to regulatory approval and Coinbase expects it will close later in 2024.

""This license would help expand access to our derivatives products by allowing Coinbase to offer them to eligible European customers in select countries across the EU,"" Coinbase said in a blog post, which was shared exclusively with CNBC on Friday.

""As the industry leader in trusted, compliant products and services, we aim for the highest standards for regulatory compliance, and before operationalizing any license or serving any users, this entity must achieve our Five-point Global Compliance Standard.""",,[],2024-01-05 00:00:00
Crypto firms introduce risk assessments and finance tests in response to strict new rules in UK,"CEO of cryptocurrency platform Coinbase Brian Armstrong attends a reception at Buckingham Palace, in central London, on November 27, 2023 to mark the conclusion of the Global Investment Summit (GIS).

Coinbase , Crypto.com, Gemini and other cryptocurrency exchanges are warning users in the U.K. that they'll need to start filling out risk assessments and investment questionnaires aimed at testing their financial knowledge.

It comes ahead of tough new rules on the advertising of digital asset products in the country.

The firms have told users in Britain that, starting Monday, they will be required to complete a declaration about what type of investor they are, and respond to a questionnaire on a range of aspects of financial services and regulation to continue using their respective platforms.

In the customer declaration section, users are asked to select their investor profile: either a high net worth individual earning above £100,000 (roughly $126,700) annually or with a net worth of more than £250,000, or a ""restricted investor"" who won't invest more than 10% of their assets. Otherwise, they cannot trade crypto.

The financial questionnaires, which vary from exchange to exchange, require users to respond to numerous queries about what range of products the firms offer, the volatile nature of crypto asset prices and the treatment of crypto as a product by financial regulators.

If a customer fails to complete the tasks successfully, they will be prevented from trading with their crypto account.

Since the passing of the Financial Services and Markets Act, a major package of financial services reforms in the U.K., firms that offer crypto and a certain type of digital currency called stablecoins are now covered by the law and must adhere to the same rules as those that govern traditional financial services.

Since Oct. 8, firms seeking to promote cryptoassets in the U.K. to retail customers must be authorized or registered with the country's Financial Conduct Authority, or have their marketing approved by an FCA-authorized firm.

Coinbase said the changes were made ""to ensure we are meeting UK investor protection standards, which require our users to have the necessary knowledge to make informed investment decisions.""

""This process is also part of Coinbase's commitment to working collaboratively with local regulators so that we can best serve our users now and in the future,"" a Coinbase spokesperson told CNBC via email.

A Crypto.com spokesperson gave similar reasoning for the move, saying its changes were made ""primarily to ensure customers understand the risks of investing in cryptocurrency, which is a key component of the important consumer protections being put in place by the FCA.""

""We do not expect this to impact user activity in the UK and as always our customer service team is on hand to help with any queries,"" George Tucker, U.K. general manager of Crypto.com, told CNBC via email.

""As an authorised Electronic Money Institution and registered cryptoasset business in the U.K., Crypto.com supports and complies with the FCA's rules and will continue to work with the regulator as we expand our product offering here,"" Tucker added.",,[],2024-01-05 00:00:00

Why Palo Alto Networks hitting $100 billion in market value is just the beginning,"Palo Alto Networks this month became the first cybersecurity company to eclipse $100 billion in market value. We believe it can get plenty bigger. On Dec. 14, it traded above market cap milestone for the first time when shares hit an all-time intraday high of $318 each. The stock has yet to close above that level. Hitting the $100 billion mark was a long-held goal CEO Nikesh Arora, but should be viewed as a new beginning, not an end. Shares could move higher in 2024 even if the operating environment proves more challenging. Palo Alto is the ""winner and new champion of cybersecurity,"" Jim Cramer said recently. PANW YTD mountain Palo Alto Networks (PANW) year-to-date performance While PANW shares have cooled off a bit recently, the company's leadership in the industry, coupled with strong demand and a robust customer base, will serve it well in the new year. First, we like investing in cybersecurity, a secular theme expected to grow in the coming years, regardless of the economic backdrop. And Palo Alto has shown it can perform during uncertain times — with interest rates at 22-year highs — and will continue to do so as the Federal Reserve looks to cut rates in 2024. Cybersecurity threats to companies are only going in one direction: up. ""This year has been a phenomenal year for cybersecurity stocks,"" Arora told Jim in a recent interview , arguing that more companies will rely on the kinds of services Palo Alto provides. ""And I think it's just the beginning."" Shares of Palo Alto have more than doubled in price throughout 2023, up a whopping 116%. Despite the corporate needs for cybersecurity, we are aware that spending could get cut if we tip into a recession next year. On top of that, the high cost of money and customers seeking shorter-term duration contracts are potential headwinds. This was one reason for the billings pressure last quarter , which hit the stock price. We said to look past it and to buy off the weakness, focusing instead on the low churn and strong remaining performance obligation growth (revenue that has been contracted but not yet invoiced.) Still, it is something we're monitoring. Palo Alto does minimize wild swings in its performance by offering diverse and less-cyclical revenue channels — a strategy that sets it apart from more narrowly focused peers like Fortinet and Tenable . It is also taking advantage of the trend of companies consolidating their budgets around the largest and best names like Palo Alto that offer a wide array of security solutions. As Jim previously remarked, Palo Alto is the only ""real soup-to-nuts cyber play."" Morgan Stanley analysts said Palo Alto's artificial intelligence capabilities give it an edge over the competition. ""With large unique data sets and market leadership across multiple major security categories, we think PANW is best positioned among the pure-play security vendors to deliver AI-driven security automation, which underpins the path beyond $100 billion,"" the analysts wrote in a recent research note. Although AI is not a core part of the Club's investment thesis for Palo Alto, we like management's progress in this fast-growing business. Finally, we think regulation will play a role in boosting demand for Palo Alto's products in 2024. The Securities and Exchange Commission recently issued new rules for publicly-listed U.S. companies, requiring them to file Form 8-K reports after a material cybersecurity incident. As businesses begin to comply with this new mandate, which went into effect last week, analysts argue that many will upgrade their Security Operations Centers (SOC). As a result, companies will need to invest in SOC and other cybersecurity infrastructure offered by cybersecurity firms like Palo Alto to meet these regulatory requirements.

Vans owner VF Corp. shares tumble as it says cyberattack could hamper holiday fulfillment,"Shares of The North Face and Vans owner VF Corp . tumbled Monday after the company reported that a hack had affected its ability to fulfill some orders ahead of the holidays.

The company said hackers encrypted ""some"" systems and made off with personal data. Those are some hallmarks of ransomware, where attackers try to extort companies in exchange for hefty payment. VF Corp. declined to comment on whether the incident was a ransomware attack.

The stock closed down more than 7% Monday.

VF Corp. announced the incident on the same day that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's new cyber disclosure rules took effect. Those regulations mandate that companies report ""material cybersecurity incidents"" to their investors within four days of determining that a hack would have an effect on their bottom lines. VF Corp. first identified hackers in its system on Dec. 13, meaning it took relatively little time for the company to identify the threat as material.

The attack is expected to hit the company's operations in the lead up to the critical holiday shopping period. The company said the breach has affected its ability to fulfill orders, but customers will still be able to place them online.

The full scope of the attack is still not known, and it will likely continue to have a material impact until recovery efforts are complete, the company said.

The new SEC rules are designed to give investors a clearer picture of how attacks can harm businesses. When casino firm Caesars Entertainment was breached earlier this year, for example, the company quietly paid a $15 million ransom, sources previously told CNBC. Only after MGM Resorts was hit by the same attacker did Caesars disclose that it had been affected.

Under the new disclosure obligations, Caesars likely would have had to report the hack and the payment much earlier. Regulators and law enforcement strongly discourage companies from paying ransoms. But given the debilitating effects that cyber disruptions can have, many companies do so anyway.

VF Corp. is the latest major company to be hit a by cyberattack that disrupted company operations. In addition to Caesars and MGM, Clorox was hit by a breach that prevented the company from keeping its items on store shelves earlier this year.",,[],2023-12-18 00:00:00
"17-year-old used $2,000 in savings to start an Amazon side hustle—now it brings in $34,000 a month","Bella Lin, 17, started a side hustle to give her guinea pigs more quality of life. Last year, it brought in more than $410,000 in revenue.

At age 12, Bella Lin had a problem. Her guinea pigs were disappearing. In those days, Lin let her three guinea pigs roam her parents' grassy, fenced-in backyard just outside of San Francisco. It was better than the alternative, she thought: The two-pound creatures ""looked miserable"" in their cramped, ""prison-barred"" cage, Lin, now 17, tells CNBC Make It. She assumed the first, Snoopy, had escaped and she continued letting her guinea pigs outside — until her dad watched an eagle fly away with another, she recalls. Determined to keep the pets out of traditional cages, she started drawing prototypes. Lin, a senior at Khan Lab School in Mountain View, California, went through several models and invested roughly $2,000 from her savings to launch her side hustle GuineaLoft on Amazon in November 2022. It sold nearly 11,000 cages and brought in more than $410,000 last year — roughly $34,000 per month, on average — according to documents reviewed by Make It. In addition to a full academic course load, extracurriculars and college applications, Lin works about 20 hours per week on GuineaLoft, she says. Here's how she built a side hustle so successful that she's considering delaying college to concentrate on her business.

An unprofitable side hustle led to an 'epiphany'

Lin told her dad, a computer programmer, that she wanted to create a better cage. He had a connection to a family-owned factory in China through a former client, and he made an introduction, Lin says. After a year of mocking up prototypes, Lin got distracted by a different idea: She wanted to sell athleisure for girls at a lower price point than large, trendy brands. She researched, found another factory in China, connected with it, and made a business plan to sell leggings starting at $23.

GuineaLoft's first prototypes were built from her parents' dining room table using office supplies, Lin says. Bella Lin

That side hustle, called TLeggings, launched in July 2019. It brought in roughly $300,000 in revenue in 2020, she says. It also earned Lin a spot at BizWorld, a project-based entrepreneurship program for 16- to 22-year-olds. She completed a 12-week curriculum and worked with a business mentor, but failed to win the pitching contest — and any prize money — at the end of the program. It was one of a few signs that TLeggings was fizzling out: Despite the lofty revenue numbers, the company was never profitable, and Lin struggled to keep up with her competitors. She shuttered it in early 2022, and refocused on GuineaLoft. ""I had a weird epiphany [where] I kind of realized there are a lot of other companies trying to [make leggings],"" Lin says. ""There was no innovation there, whereas with GuineaLoft, I could fill a really big gap in the market.""

Tinkering between classes and late at night

Lin realized her early prototypes were promising, but imperfect. Traditional guinea pig cages are made with bars, roofs and either tarp or plastic bottoms. They are difficult to clean, Lin says, and often reek of excrement. Her early glass, open-floor enclosures allowed for more visibility and mobility, and featured a two-tiered bottom. Dirty bedding could be pushed into a removable plastic tray. But the glass was too expensive to ship, and her smaller guinea pigs' feet got stuck in the floor.

Lin's pets roaming around freely in their GuineaLoft enclosures Bella Lin

Lin rearranged her schedule so she could do her homework in between periods at school. She stayed up late to research and virtually test products with her six-person team in China — a manufacturing lead who works for the factory, and five full-time GuineaLoft employees who'd previously worked with Lin's dad or the factory's leadership. Those six people source, manufacture, package and photograph the products, says Lin. She manages GuineaLoft's product design, pricing, marketing — TLeggings taught her a lot about social media in particular, she says — and overall business strategy. Ultimately the company went with acrylic instead of glass and constructed replaceable bottoms from biodegradable, wax-coated paper — similar, Lin says, to ""airplane barf bags."" The bottoms are easy to throw out, which is good for business: Once satisfied GuineaLoft customers run out, they have to come back to Lin's Amazon store to restock.

Winning a $10,000 competition

The factory produced 100 cages in its first batch. Lin was elated when three sold in the first couple of hours. Within two weeks, GuineaLoft all 100 were gone ""with no marketing,"" she says. She re-applied to BizWorld last year, and won $10,000 in investment funds from the pitching competition. That money will go toward adding accessories and new cages for different types of small pets, like rabbits and hamsters, she says.

Lin has owned guinea pigs for years, and has kept up to 10 at one time, she says. Bella Lin",,[],2024-01-05 00:00:00

WASHINGTON — Former President Donald Trump received at least $7.8 million in payments from foreign governments during two of his four years in the White House, according to a report released Thursday by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee. At least 20 foreign governments made the payments to Trump's businesses during the two-year period that the committee was able to review. The information in the report was first reported by The New York Times and CNN. Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., the ranking member on the Oversight Committee, said in a foreword that the payments came from ""some of the world's most unsavory regimes,"" with China being the leading spender, paying more than $5.5 million to Trump-owned properties, according to the report. Trump also received payments from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, India and Afghanistan, the report said. ""This is a limited window on a far-broader universe of foreign government spending that took place,"" Raskin told reporters Thursday on Capitol Hill.

""Yet Donald Trump, while holding the office of president, used his business entities to pocket millions of dollars from foreign states and royalty and never once went to Congress to seek its consent,"" Raskin wrote.

The payments were made to properties owned by Trump, according to the report, including his hotels in Washington, D.C., Las Vegas and New York City.

Yemen's Houthi rebels launched fresh attacks on cargo ships in the Red Sea, while the U.S. carried out strikes against targets in Iraq, amid fears that the war in the Gaza Strip could engulf the Middle East.

The U.S. military carried out retaliatory strikes against three installations in Iraq linked to Kataib Hezbollah on Monday, the Pentagon announced, after three American service personnel were injured in a one-way drone attack carried out by the Iran-aligned militant group.

U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said in a statement that there is ""no higher priority"" than the protection of American troops and interests.

""While we do not seek to escalate conflict in the region, we are committed and fully prepared to take further necessary measures to protect our people and our facilities,"" Austin added.

Vivek Ramaswamy's campaign stops all TV ad spending less than a month before Iowa and New Hampshire,"Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy speaks during the third Republican presidential primary debate at the Knight Concert Hall at the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts in Miami, Florida, on November 8, 2023.

Vivek Ramaswamy's presidential campaign has stopped spending money on television ads and does not have any TV ad reservations booked, according to his campaign and data from an ad-tracking firm.

As recently as the first full week of December, the GOP entrepreneur's campaign spent more than $200,000 on TV ads. Last week, it spent just $6,000 on ads — all of it on TV — figures from the firm AdImpact show.

Ramaswamy's campaign says it is still spending money on ads, just not on TV.

""We are focused on bringing out the voters we've identified — best way to reach them is using addressable advertising, mail, text, live calls and doors to communicate with our voters on Vivek's vision for America, making their plan to caucus and turning them out,"" Tricia McLaughlin, the campaign's press secretary told NBC News.

""As you know, this isn't what most campaigns look like. We have intentionally structured this way so that we have the ability to be nimble and hypertargeted in our ad spending,"" McLaughlin added.

The shift in strategy comes less than a month before the Jan. 15 Iowa caucuses — the first contest in the GOP presidential nominating process — and the Jan. 23 New Hampshire primary.

In early November, Ramaswamy's campaign announced that it planned to spend over $10 million on ads — broadcast, cable, radio, digital and direct mail — in Iowa and New Hampshire. Since that announcement, the campaign has spent $2.2 million on TV, digital and radio ads, according to AdImpact.

Ramaswamy's rivals — former President Donald Trump, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie — are still buying up ads on the U.S. airwaves. In the same week that Ramaswamy spent just $6,000 on TV ads, Trump's campaign spent $1.1 million, followed by Haley's $1 million, DeSantis' $270,000 and Christie's $88,000.

That's in addition to the ad money being spent by the super PACs backing Ramaswamy's opponents.

SFA Fund Inc., a group backing Haley, spent $4.8 million on all ads last week. Fight Right, a group backing DeSantis, spent $1.3 million, followed by MAGA Inc.'s $987,000 and almost $700,000 by Tell It Like It Is PAC, which supports Christie.

Supreme Court sidesteps decision on Trump presidential immunity claim in federal election interference case,"U.S. President Donald Trump in the Cabinet Room at the White House in Washington, July 9, 2020.

Steering clear of a political firestorm for now, the Supreme Court said Friday it would not immediately decide the key issue of whether former President Donald Trump has broad immunity for actions he took challenging the 2020 presidential election results.

The court denied without comment special counsel Jack Smith's request asking the justices to circumvent the normal appeals court process and quickly decide the legal question, which looms large in Trump's criminal prosecution in Washington over allegations of election interference.

If Trump were to win on this threshold issue, the charges would be dismissed. If he loses, the legal proceedings in the trial court would continue, with Trump having other issues he could mount appeals over.

As a result of the court's refusal to intervene, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit will take first crack at the issue; it is scheduled to hear oral arguments on Jan. 9.

Once that court rules, the Supreme Court could act quickly on whether to take up the case.

In asking the court to step in on an expedited basis, Smith said the case ""presents a fundamental question at the heart of our democracy: whether a former President is absolutely immune from federal prosecution for crimes committed while in office.""

Trump's lawyers argued in court papers that Smith had given ""no compelling reason"" why the Supreme Court should immediately step in ahead of the appeals court.

On Dec. 7, Washington-based U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan denied Trump's motion to dismiss his indictment on presidential immunity and constitutional grounds. The case is on hold while Trump appeals the decision.

Trump's lawyers argue that his role in questioning the result of the election was within the ""outer perimeter"" of his official responsibilities as president, citing a 1982 Supreme Court ruling about presidential immunity. Therefore, under Supreme Court precedent, Trump is immune from prosecution, his lawyers say.

They also say the Senate's acquittal of Trump following impeachment proceedings over his role in events that led to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol means he cannot be separately prosecuted for the same actions.

Smith argues that Trump's role in seeking to overturn the election was not related to his official responsibilities as president and that the Constitution's language on impeachment allows for separate criminal proceedings even if the president is acquitted.

In August, a federal grand jury in Washington indicted Trump on four charges: conspiracy to defraud the U.S., conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction, and conspiracy against the right to vote and to have one's vote counted. Trump pleaded not guilty.

The election interference case is one of four criminal prosecutions Trump faces heading into the 2024 presidential election season, in which he is a front-runner for the Republican nomination.",,[],2023-12-22 00:00:00
U.S. swaps Maduro ally for 'Fat Leonard' in Venezuela prisoner exchange,"US President Joe Biden speaks on his economic policies at the Wisconsin Black Chamber of Commerce in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on December 20, 2023.

The United States on Wednesday released from jail an accused money launderer close to Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro in exchange for that country sending home 10 American prisoners and a defense contractor at the center of a massive bribery conspiracy that tainted the U.S. Navy, according to U.S. President Joe Biden.

The Maduro government also released 20 political prisoners in Venezuela as part of the deal.

Biden said that Venezuela has agreed to send to U.S. custody the former fugitive Leonard Francis, also known as ""Fat Leonard,"" who was at the center of what a senior administration official called ""one of the most brazen bribery conspiracies in the U.S. Navy's history.""

Francis, who is from Malaysia, fled from house arrest in San Diego, California in September 2022, and then traveled to Cuba and Venezuela with his plan to end up in Russia.

From 2004 to 2013, Francis rewarded senior Navy officers with prostitutes, luxury travel, Cuban cigars, Kobe beef and other gifts for providing him with confidential information to benefit his company, prosecutors have said.

Biden in a statement Wednesday said Francis now ""will face justice for the crimes he committed against the U.S. Government and the American people.""",,[],2023-12-20 00:00:00
U.S. Bank fined $36 million for freezing unemployment debit cards during Covid-19 pandemic,"WASHINGTON — The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Tuesday announced it has fined U.S. Bank nearly $21 million for cutting off access to unemployment insurance benefits during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency imposed an additional $15 million penalty on the bank over the same practices.

""U.S. Bank blocked access to accounts and demanded burdensome paperwork in order for consumers to regain access to their frozen benefits,"" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement.

The fifth-largest commercial bank in the country, U.S. Bank administered prepaid debit cards to distribute unemployment insurance benefits through its ReliaCard program.

But starting in the summer of 2020, when unemployment rose close to 15%, the bank froze tens of thousands of accounts due to suspected fraud. It then failed to provide a reliable method for consumers with frozen cards to regain access to their benefit money, the CFPB said.

As part of the settlement, the bank did not admit or deny wrongdoing.

Between March 2020 and July 2021, states issued $794 billion in combined state and federal unemployment benefits.

The demand for the prepaid cards ""grew nearly 4000%,"" during the pandemic, Cheryl Leamon, a representative for U.S. Bank, told CNBC.

""While a small portion of cardholders were affected due to extended holds, we prevented fraud of over $375 million and returned to the states hundreds of millions in additional funds sent to questionable accounts,"" Leamon said. The bank has since made enhancements to the ReliaCard program, Leamon added.

Users who had their accounts frozen between August 2020 and March 2021 waited an average of a few weeks to a month or more to regain access to benefits because U.S. Bank did not provide an easy method to verify identities.

The $15 million OCC portion of the fine was related to alleged unfair practices under the Federal Trade Commission Act.

U.S. Bank also violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act and failed to immediately investigate alleged unauthorized electronic fund transfers under the EFT Act, according to the CFPB.

Consumers were unable to access the funds that had been reported as unauthorized, because the bank incorrectly required additional written confirmation about the transactions and did not dispense provisional credits without it.

""U.S. Bank must comply with the law, and the CFPB and OCC are making the bank pay for its conduct,"" Chopra said.

Under a consent order, U.S. Bank will provide $5.7 million in redress to consumers and pay a $15 million civil money penalty. The OCC penalty will be paid to the U.S. Treasury.

U.S. Bank is based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and had $668 billion in assets as of Sept. 30, according to the CFPB.",,[],2023-12-19 00:00:00
White House announces new steps toward launching its climate corps for young people,"US President Joe Biden speaks alongside Ritika Shah, award-winner of the first-ever National Climate Assessment Art x Climate competition, about his administrations actions to combat climate change in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building adjacent to the White House in Washington, DC, November 14, 2023.

The White House continued to draw similarities to President Franklin Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps , which was established in 1933 for unemployed young men to work on preserving public lands to combat low employment numbers during the Great Depression.

According to the White House, nearly 50,000 people from every state and territory, including Puerto Rico, have signed up to learn more about joining the ACC since it was first announced, and a portal to apply will be launched next spring.

The ACC almost entirely hinges on the interest of young Americans applying to join the program. The corps will host a number of ""virtual listening sessions"" in January to engage young people, hear their priorities and discuss on a local level how best to implement the program in different areas that are facing different climate realities. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., are set to join those talks.

The new corps will be led across a partnership of federal agencies: the departments of Commerce, Interior, Agriculture, Labor and Energy, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency and AmeriCorps.

The highly anticipated first steps for the American Climate Corps, or ACC, were shared exclusively with NBC News on Tuesday, as the administration seeks to launch the first cohort by next summer.

After facing setbacks in Congress, the Biden administration has unlocked funding to launch its American Climate Corps, a new federal program that looks to employ thousands of young Americans in the clean energy, conservation and climate resilience sectors.

(L-R) U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA), and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) hold a news conference on the launch of the American Climate Corps outside the U.S. Capitol building on September 20, 2023 in Washington, DC.

""A historic program like this has never been done before in the lifetime of almost every single person that's working on this program,"" said Maggie Thomas, special assistant for climate to President Joe Biden.

The administration had sought to fund the ACC through the Inflation Reduction Act, which passed Congress last year, but the funding was ultimately dropped from the final language of the IRA. The White House now hopes to use funds for climate-minded programs across multiple agencies to carry out the vision of the American Climate Corps.

Five states — California, Colorado, Maine, Michigan and Washington — have already launched climate corps programs, and the federal program will lean on them as implementing partners.

""We continue to think that Congress spending is still a good idea, that hasn't changed, but we continue to use our creativity, to make sure that we really are using every tool available to us to tackle the climate crisis,"" Thomas said. ""We engage every agency and we really pull in this new diverse generation of young people to ensure that we can tackle the climate crisis in all the ways we know we need to.""

As the White House works to set up the ACC to launch its first cohort, it is tapping existing funding to carry out the program's vision of increasing pathways for young people to launch careers in environmental justice.

The first such program the administration is targeting is the EPA's Environmental and Climate Justice Community Change Grants program, which received $2 billion in funding from the Inflation Reduction Act last month. That funding will be used to implement and staff projects that focus on reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in underserved communities, including ""an option for communities to propose their own Climate Corps program"" that would put young people on those projects, the White House said.

""What we're doing is writing into our funding opportunities the option for local communities to take advantage of this tool,"" Thomas said. ""And if this is the right tool for them, we want to make sure that there are ways for them to apply and to get money to do so. We, at the federal level, are working to stitch together all of these programs across the federal agency and set up the federal infrastructure to make these local programs a success.""

Rosemary Enobakhare, associate administrator for public engagement at the EPA, said the agency is targeting young people ""and really making sure that they're all a part of this work.""

""Young people are not shy about asking questions. ... The EPA is really leaning in, and really telling the story around how climate is impacting communities and how young people are the future,"" Enobakhare said. ""And they're going to hear this plan, and they need to be a part of the solution.""",,[],2023-12-19 00:00:00
New Hampshire man charged with death threat to Vivek Ramaswamy,"Republican presidential candidate and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy speaks at the Republican Party's First in the Nation Leadership Summit in Nashua, New Hampshire, U.S., October 13, 2023.

A New Hampshire man was arrested on a charge of threatening to kill Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy and his supporters at a campaign event in the state, the U.S. Department of Justice said Monday.

The man, Tyler Anderson, last week allegedly responded to a Ramaswamy campaign text message about a meet-and-greet breakfast in Portsmouth on Monday with a death threat to the candidate and ""everyone who attends,"" according to an affidavit attached to the criminal complaint.

""Great, another opportunity for me to blow his brains out!"" 30-year-old Anderson wrote in response to the campaign text, the affidavit said.

The candidate is not named in the charging document filed against the Dover resident in U.S. District Court in New Hampshire.

But his campaign confirmed he was the target of the threat.

""We are grateful to law enforcement for their swiftness and professionalism in handling this matter and pray for the safety of all Americans,"" a Ramaswamy spokesperson told NBC News.

After his arrest, Anderson admitted to police that he sent threatening messages to the candidate and ""multiple other campaigns,"" the affidavit said.

Former Speaker Kevin McCarthy to resign from Congress at year-end,"Former Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) speaks to reporters after he was ousted from the position of Speaker by a vote of the House of Representatives at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S. October 3, 2023.

Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said Wednesday he will resign from Congress at the end of the year.

McCarthy, the California Republican who was ousted as speaker by a faction of his own party two months earlier, said he is leaving ""to serve America in new ways.""

""I know my work is only getting started,"" McCarthy said in an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal.

The announcement immediately rocketed McCarthy to the top of the private sector's target list of former members of Congress who would be powerful additions to a company payroll. McCarthy was a prolific fundraiser as Republican leader and later speaker, where he built a deep network of CEOs and major donors.

California's 20th Congressional District is solidly Republican, so McCarthy's departure is not likely to result in a Democrat being elected to fill the seat.

But his absence will leave the House GOP down a member for at least a few months, further narrowing its already-slim majority and exacerbating its legislative efforts.

Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom is required under state law to call a special election within two weeks of McCarthy's seat becoming vacant. That special election must take place between 126 and 140 days later, though it may be able to coincide with California's congressional primaries on March 5.

When former Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., resigned in January 2020, Newsom left the seat open for the next 10 months.

McCarthy's work in Congress will effectively cease even earlier than the end of December: His announcement came the week before the House is scheduled to depart Capitol Hill for the rest of the year.

""I will continue to recruit our country's best and brightest to run for elected office. The Republican Party is expanding every day, and I am committed to lending my experience to support the next generation of leaders,"" McCarthy wrote in his op-ed.

He credited the House Republican majority under his leadership with a raft of fiscal policy wins and and other achievements.",,[],2023-12-06 00:00:00
Special election to replace ex-Rep. George Santos set for Feb. 13,"Progressive activists with MoveOn display a 15 foot inflatable of Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y., as they call for his expulsion from Congress, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 28, 2023.

The special election to fill expelled Rep. George Santos' House seat will be Feb. 13, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced Tuesday.

Until then, House Republicans will be down a vote, leaving them with an even narrower majority in the chamber than usual.

""As Governor, I have the solemn responsibility to call a special election to ensure the voters of Long Island and Queens once again have representation in Congress,"" Hochul, a Democrat, said in a statement.

The seat is a key part of Democrats' plan to retake the House majority next year.

Former Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi represented New York's 3rd district before Santos but left Congress in 2022 to mount a failed run for governor. Now he is a lead contender for the support of New York Democratic leaders in running for his old seat.

The House expelled Santos on Friday with significant bipartisan support. The expulsion resolution was championed by a bloc of Santos' fellow New York Republicans. A bloc of Santos' fellow New York Republicans championed the expulsion resolution.

Santos flipped the Long Island congressional district red last year. In the process, he also became the first openly gay Republican in the House.

Soon after he was elected, Santos admitted that he had lied about key aspects of his background on the campaign trail.

In May, he was charged with fraud and theft in federal court in New York. Santos was hit with additional charges in late October. He has pleaded not guilty, and his trial is set for September 2024.

""Members of Congress provide critical constituent services, serve as a link to federal agencies and advocate on behalf of the constituents who sent them to Washington,"" Hochul said Tuesday. ""I look forward working with the next representative for the 3rd Congressional District on the issues facing New Yorkers.""

Former researcher alleges Harvard forced her out to preserve Facebook donations,"Research Director of the Harvard Kennedy School's Shorenstein Center on Media Politics and Public Policy Joan Donovan researches how disinformation campaigns spread among far-right groups on the web. She poses next to her computer in Malden, MA on August 11, 2021.

WASHINGTON — Social media researcher Joan Donovan says she knows the exact moment her career began to go off the rails.

The moment led to her departure from Harvard University in what she calls a firing, which Harvard says was anything but. The resulting dispute has real-world implications for academic freedom, social media and corporate influence over research.

On Oct. 29, 2021, Donovan, a Harvard research director focused on social media and disinformation, says she was invited to address a prestigious group of wealthy donors to Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government, known as the Dean's Council.

The meeting took place over Zoom, and donors logged on from their homes and offices. Donovan says she had been invited to present the findings of her research to the group – a plum assignment she believed was due to the prominence and importance of her work.

""I was so excited,"" Donovan told CNBC. ""I thought that this is an amazing validation of the work that I had been doing.""

Donovan began to brief the donors on her research into internet disinformation and its impact on American society. The meeting fell just weeks after an explosive moment in social media: A former employee of Meta , still called Facebook at the time, named Frances Haugen turned whistleblower and went public with a secret trove of thousands of pages of internal documents from the tech giant.

Haugen had testified before Congress on Oct. 5 that the documents revealed Facebook knew its services were causing social harm, spreading misinformation and hurting teenagers. But she said the company chose profits over safety.

Now Donovan shared a bombshell of her own with the Harvard donors: She told them that she, too, had obtained the trove of documents, a massive file she considered the ""most important documents in internet history.""

She laid out an argument similar to the one Haugen had been making on national television: Facebook knew of the harm its services caused, but chose to do nothing.

Central to Donovan's thinking was the idea that Facebook was not just a victim of bad guys who exploited new technology for their own ends, but that Facebook actually designed systems that incentivized the most provocative content.

""The problem was that the design of the technology itself — social media itself, was giving bad actors a first mover advantage, especially when it came to novel and outrageous content, which is what goes viral,"" she told CNBC in an interview.

In other words, Donovan said, what was going wrong was not necessarily in the world outside Facebook, but inside the company's algorithms.

When Donovan finished explaining her findings on the Zoom call, she says she noticed one man on her screen raising his hand eagerly to speak. He was Elliot Schrage, a member of the Dean's Council donor group at Harvard and a former vice president of global communications and public policy at Facebook.

Donovan says Schrage disagreed sharply with her criticism of Facebook – so intensely that after the meeting wrapped up, Donovan sent a text to her superior at the Kennedy School, asking, ""Should I be worried about the way Schrage got mad at me?""

""I think we should have worried if he DIDN'T get mad,"" the supervisor replied, according to a text message transcript provided to CNBC.

""I thought you were just terrific. So sophisticated and fair in your thinking and analysis. Made me proud.""

Schrage declined to comment.

Facebook has publicly denied allegations that it turns a blind eye to harms caused by its services in order to profit from them.

In a lengthy response to a 2021 Wall Street Journal series based on allegations made by Haugen, the whistleblower, Facebook's vice president of global affairs and communications, Nick Clegg, wrote this: ""At the heart of this series is an allegation that is just plain false: that Facebook conducts research and then systematically and willfully ignores it if the findings are inconvenient for the company.""

""It's a claim which could only be made by cherry-picking selective quotes from individual pieces of leaked material in a way that presents complex and nuanced issues as if there is only ever one right answer,"" wrote Clegg.

As Donovan tells it, support from her superiors didn't last long after she dove into her Facebook research.

In early November, the then-dean of the Kennedy School, Douglas Elmendorf, emailed Donovan to follow up on the Dean's Council meeting, with questions about her research into Facebook. The company had changed its name to Meta on Oct. 28.

Among the issues he said he wanted to address, according to a copy of the email provided to CNBC, were ""How you define the problem of misinformation for both analysis and possible responses (algorithm-adjusting or policy making) when there is no independent arbiter of truth."" And he said he would like to know ""How the research you're conducting provides a basis for comments you're making about current events.""

The email alarmed Donovan, who believed the language in it echoed talking points Facebook executives had been using publicly. And she says she knew that Dean Elmendorf had a close personal relationship with Sheryl Sandberg, the then-chief operating officer of Facebook's parent company, Meta Platforms.

Elmendorf had been Sandberg's undergraduate advisor at Harvard, and Sandberg herself was a multimillion-dollar donor to Harvard's Kennedy School. Elmendorf attended Sandberg's wedding in the summer of 2022.

""I got called into the principal's office and was questioned about why I'm talking about Facebook,"" Donovan said. ""Interestingly, the dean never asked me about Twitter or YouTube or, you know, Google, which we also investigated. It was really about having the internal papers at Facebook and what we plan to do with them.""

Through a Harvard spokesman, Elmendorf declined to comment for the record.

Through an employee, Sandberg declined to comment. Harvard officials told The Washington Post that Elmendorf and Sandberg never discussed Donovan.

The next month, a charity operated by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan – both themselves former Harvard students – made an extraordinary announcement: It was pledging a half-billion dollars over 15 years to create a new institute at Harvard for the study of artificial intelligence, to be named after Zuckerberg's mother's family.

The scale of the contribution – and its intended use – raised eyebrows on campus. A column in the Harvard Crimson written by two undergraduates called acceptance of the donation a ""damning misstep by our institution.""

The students, Guillermo S. Hava and Eleanor V. Wikstrom, wrote: ""Our institution — our entire elite higher education system, arguably — has a penchant for auctioning off academic priorities to the highest bidder."" The Crimson column did not mention Donovan.

The December 2021 gift was the biggest, but not the first, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative donation to Harvard: Since 2018, the foundation's disclosures show it has bestowed Harvard or entities affiliated with it with dozens of grants worth multiple millions of dollars.

Donovan says her position at Harvard became increasingly untenable, as the months went on. She came to believe that administrators wanted her to leave. ""I became persona non grata when I turned my attention specifically to Facebook,"" says Donovan.

The situation came to a head in a meeting with Elmendorf in the summer of 2022, Donovan says, at which the dean told her she would have to wind down her program, known as the Technology and Social Change Research Project, by June 2024.

Donovan says Elmendorf also told her during the meeting, ""I want you to know that you do not have academic freedom,"" adding ""I want to remind you that you're staff here.""

As a staff member, Donovan was not afforded the same protections that are extended to tenured professors.

Donovan felt constrained, and says she was told that for the remainder of the project she could not start any new projects or hire additional staffers.

""That to me is an egregious and anti-intellectual obstruction of academic freedom,"" Donovan said. ""It contradicts the entire reason why a university exists, which is to share the light with the world.""

On July 13, nearly a year before the date she says she had been given for the conclusion of her project, Donovan says she was informed that Harvard was ending the project on Aug. 31 and that her role as research director was being eliminated.

Donovan's account of her departure was laid out in a disclosure document sent to Harvard on Nov. 28 by Whistleblower Aid, the same nonprofit group that worked with Facebook whistleblower Haugen in 2021.

Whistleblower Aid sent Donovan's allegations to the Office of the Attorney General of Massachusetts, which is reviewing the material, according to an official.

The group also raised Donovan's allegations with the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights. A spokesperson for the department said the office does not confirm or deny the existence of complaints.

In a statement to CNBC, Harvard Kennedy School Director of Public Affairs James Smith disputed Donovan's account of her departure. ""The document's allegations of unfair treatment and donor interference are false,"" Smith said. ""The narrative is full of inaccuracies and baseless insinuations, particularly the suggestion that Harvard Kennedy School allowed Facebook to dictate its approach to research.""

Smith explained that Donovan's situation was related to her employment status at the university. ""By longstanding policy to uphold academic standards, all research projects at Harvard Kennedy School need to be led by faculty members,"" he said.

""Joan Donovan was hired as a staff member (not a faculty member) to manage a media manipulation project. When the original faculty leader of the project left Harvard, the School tried for some time to identify another faculty member who had time and interest to lead the project. After that effort did not succeed, the project was given more than a year to wind down. Joan Donovan was not fired, and most members of the research team chose to remain at the School in new roles.""

Donovan concludes that the core finding of her research was antithetical to Facebook, and ultimately to Harvard.

""I believe Harvard took me out because I was not toeing the company line about platforms, which is you can stay safe from companies if you suggest that this is a whole of the internet problem,"" she said. ""Social media is not to blame.""

What she had concluded about Facebook was quite the opposite – the design of social media itself was causing problems: ""I was picking apart their design and saying the way this works is enabling genocide, terrorism, hate, harassment, incitement.""

Donovan was out.

""Harvard hastened my exit by firing me,"" she said. ""But I feel really good about what we did to make sure that my team was safe, to make sure that the information that needed to get out there was out there.""

Smith told CNBC that Harvard University and the Kennedy School continue to carry out misinformation and social media research to this day. He noted that a faculty member constructed and posted online the Facebook Archive, consisting of documents originally leaked by Haugen.

In October, the Kennedy School's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy and Harvard's Public Interest Tech Lab jointly published the Facebook Archive, containing the documents obtained by Haugen in a searchable database open to the public at FBarchive.org.

A spokesperson for Meta declined to comment.

"Former U.S. ambassador spied for Cuba for decades, Justice Department says","File photo of former US ambassador to Bolivia, Manuel Rocha, talking to the press on the 11th of July 2001.

A retired American diplomat made his first court appearance Monday in Miami in a potentially explosive espionage case.

Prosecutors say Victor Manuel Rocha, 73, spent more than 40 years spying for Cuba while he rose through the State Department, where he was U.S. ambassador to Bolivia during the Clinton administration.

Rocha's case is ""one of the highest-reaching and longest-lasting infiltrations of the United States government by a foreign agent,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland said Monday at a press conference.

Rocha has been charged in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida with one count of Acting as an Illegal Agent of a Foreign Government, one count of conspiracy to do so and a third count, Use of a Passport Obtained by a False Statement. The Dec. 1 complaint was unsealed Monday.

But the sworn accounts by FBI agents paint a much bigger picture of Rocha's alleged activities than the individual charges convey.

""Beginning no later than approximately 1981, and continuing to the present, Rocha secretly supported the Republic of Cuba and its clandestine intelligence-gathering mission against the United States by serving as a covert agent of Cuba's intelligence services,"" the indictment alleges.

""To further that role, Rocha obtained and maintained employment in the United States government in positions that provided him: (1) access to nonpublic information, including classified information; and (2) the ability to affect United States foreign policy,"" wrote prosecutors.

Rocha was apprehended as the result of a yearlong undercover FBI operation, according to the DOJ.

Undercover FBI agents posing as Cuban operatives met with Rocha several times in the past year, according to the complaint.

The life Rocha allegedly described to them sounded like the plot of HBO's spy thriller ""The Americans.""

""Since the Direcciön asked me ... to lead a normal life ... I have – have created the legend of a right-wing person,"" Rocha allegedly said, referring to the Cuban intelligence services. Legend is a spycraft term for the fictitious biography a covert agent cultivates to conceal their identity.",,[],2023-12-04 00:00:00
